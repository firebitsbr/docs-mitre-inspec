# vendor-product-version-edition[-stig|cis]-baseline

    Examples: microsoft-iis-8.5-site-stig-baseline (specific version)
              apache-tomcat-7-cis-baseline (7.x)
              rsa-archer-6-baseline (6.x)

InSpec Profile to validate the secure configuration of vendor product-version-edition, against the [<DISA/CIS/vendor>](http://linktosite)'s **<CIS Benchmark|DISA STIG, etc.> version <x.y.z>**.

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __<transport_protocol>__.

    Note to be removed: Changed it from "component" to "the target" because we talk about "Ruby language components" below. 
    
__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

    NOTE: This is for situations where the user needs to provide attribute configurations, 
    credentials, etc. to inspec (e.g., rsa archer instance, database, etc.) so 
    it knows what to target. 
    
The following attributes must be configured in an attributes file for the profile to run correctly. More information about InSpec attributes can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).

```
# Description of attribute
attribute-name: default-value

# Username for MSSQL DB Server
user: null

# Password for MSSQL DB Server
password: null

# Hostname of MSSQL DB Server
host: null

# Instance name of MSSQL DB Server
instance: null

# Port number of MSSQL DB Server
port: 49789

# Name of the specific database being evaluated within the MSSQL DB Server
db_name: 'master'
```
The following environment variables must also be set in order for the profile to run correctly. 

Windows
```
$ setx VARIABLE_NAME=value
```

UNIX/Linux/MacOS
```
$ export VARIABLE_NAME=value
```

## Running This Profile

    inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/<project>.git --attrs=<path_to_your_attributes_file/name_of_your_attributes_file.yml> --target=<transport-protocol>://<hostip> --user=<admin-account> --password=<password> --reporter cli json:<filename>.json 

Runs this profile over __<transport_protocol>__ to the host at IP address __hostip__ as a privileged user account (i.e., an account with administrative privileges), reporting results to both the command line interface (cli) and to a machine-readable JSON file. 

    NOTE: Provide a usable example based on instructions above. 
    Example:
    inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/stig-microsoft-iis-8.5-site-baseline.git --attrs=<path_to_your_attributes_file/name_of_your_attributes_file.yml> --target=winrm://$winhostip --user=Administrator --password=Pa55w0rd --reporter cli json:my-iis-site.json 

## Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __full heimdall server__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
