# vendor-product-version-edition[-stig|cis]-baseline

    Examples: microsoft-iis-8.5-site-stig-baseline (specific version)
              apache-tomcat-7-cis-baseline (7.x)
              rsa-archer-6-baseline (6.x)
              microsoft-azure-cis-foundations-baseline

InSpec Profile to validate the secure configuration of vendor product-version-edition, against the [<DISA/CIS/vendor>](http://linktosite)'s **<CIS Benchmark|DISA STIG, etc.> version <x.y.z>**.

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __<transport_protocol>__.

__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

Git is required to download the latest InSpec profiles using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site. 

__START-OPTIONAL-ATTRIBUTES-TEXT__<br/>
The following attributes must be configured in an attributes file for the profile to run correctly. More information about InSpec attributes can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).

```
# Attribute description
attribute_name: 'value'
```
__END-OPTIONAL-ATTRIBUTES-TEXT__

## Running This Profile
When the __"runner"__ host uses this profile overlay for the first time, follow these steps: 

```
mkdir profiles
cd profiles
git clone https://<baseline_repo>.git
cd vendor-product-version-edition[-stig|cis-]-baseline
bundle install
cd ..
inspec exec vendor-product-version-edition[-stig|cis-]-baseline --attrs=<path_to_your_attributes_file/name_of_your_attributes_file.yml> [-t <transport_protocol>://<hostname>:<port> --user=<username> --password=<password>] --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```
For every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this profile:

```
cd profiles/<baseline_repo>
git pull
cd ..
inspec exec vendor-product-version-edition[-stig|cis-]-baseline --attrs=<path_to_your_attributes_file/name_of_your_attributes_file.yml> [-t <transport_protocol>://<hostname>:<port> --user=<username> --password=<password>] --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```

## Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __full heimdall server__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
