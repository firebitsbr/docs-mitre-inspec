# vendor-product-version-edition[-stig|cis]-baseline

    Examples: microsoft-iis-8.5-site-stig-baseline (specific version)
              apache-tomcat-7-cis-baseline (7.x)
              rsa-archer-6-baseline (6.x)


InSpec Profile to validate the secure configuration of vendor product-version-edition, against the [<DISA/CIS/vendor>](http://linktosite)'s **<CIS Benchmark|DISA STIG, etc.> version <x.y.z>**.

    Note to be removed: Moving forward, maybe we should just base our profiles, 
    etc. on the version of the benchmark, stig, etc. since that is how 
    people will use it? I am not sure they care what our versions are 
    plus they don't change a ton after the fact. Or, if we really feel 
    the need to have our own versioning scheme maybe we can have 
    something like <benchmark|stig version>_<semver>. 

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __<transport_protocol>__.

    Note to be removed: Changed it from "component" to "the target" because we talk about "Ruby language components" below. 
    
__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

## Running This Profile

    inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/<project>/archive/master.tar.gz -t <transport-protocol>://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --reporter cli json:<filename>.json

Runs this profile over <transport-protocol> to the host at IP address <hostip> as a privileged user account (i.e., an account with administrative privileges), reporting results to both the command line interface (cli) and to a machine-readable JSON file. 

    NOTE: Provide a usable example based on instructions above. 
    Example:
    inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/stig-microsoft-iis-8.5-site-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz -t winrm://$winhostip --user 'Administrator --password=Pa55w0rd --reporter cli json:my-iis-site.json

## Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __full heimdall server__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
